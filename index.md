Hi, I’m Tom. I make things on the internet. I’m excited about JavaScript Apps, Audio and Midi in the browser, and generally making great experiences on the web.

If you have an idea for a project (web or otherwise), I would love to hear from you, just send me a message on [LinkedIn][LinkedIn], or fill in the the [form](/contact.html).

You can find some of my recent projects on [LinkedIn][LinkedIn] and [GitHub][GitHub].
