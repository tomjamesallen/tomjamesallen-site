Hi, I’m Tom. I’m a front end web developer working in-house for [Focusrite][focusrite] & [Novation][novation]. In my free time I like to take [photos][flickr], build websites (like [this one][ounce]) and tinker with [webbish projects][github]. I also pretend at being a [musician][soundcloud] from time to time.

If you have any ideas for a project (web or otherwise), I would love to hear from you, just send me a message on twitter, or fill in the form below. Alternatively you can find more of the stuff I’ve done in any of the following places:
