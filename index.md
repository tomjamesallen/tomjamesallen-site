Hi, I’m Tom. I’m a front end web developer working in-house for [Novation][novation] & [Focusrite][focusrite]. In my free time I like to take [photos][flickr], build websites (like [this one][ounce]) and tinker with [webbish projects][github]. I also pretend at being a musician from time to time.

If you have any ideas for a project (web or otherwise), I would love to hear from you, just send me a message on twitter, or fill in the [form](/contact.html). Alternatively you can find more of the stuff I’ve done in any of the following places:
